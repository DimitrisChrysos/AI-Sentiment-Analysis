# 🧠 AI Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains three sentiment classification models developed for the course **Artificial Intelligence II – Deep Learning for NLP** (Spring 2024–2025). The models classify English-language tweets into positive or negative sentiment using increasingly advanced techniques.

## 📝 Assignments Overview

### 🔹 Assignment 1: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
A classical machine learning approach using TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression. Serves as a strong baseline for sentiment classification.

### 🔹 Assignment 2: Neural Network + Word2Vec
A feedforward neural network built with PyTorch, leveraging Word2Vec embeddings for semantic understanding of tweet content.

### 🔹 Assignment 3: Fine-tuned Transformers (BERT & DistilBERT)
State-of-the-art transformer-based models fine-tuned using HuggingFace’s `transformers` library for high-accuracy sentiment classification.
